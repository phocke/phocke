## Welcome to My GitHub! üöÄ

Hi, I'm Shem - I take care of tech, techies, and tech users. I've had the privilege of working at DataCamp, thoughtbot, and now Clari. Throughout my career, I've built two tech teams and authored a guide on the topic, which you can check out here: [Why and How to Build Your Tech Team in Poland](https://phocke.gumroad.com/l/qzUPq).

Although I humorously claim to be a Rails contributor for correcting a few typos in the documentation, you can see my earth-shattering contributions here: [Rails Documentation Typos](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/przemek-hocke/commits).

I was also featured in the most popular software blog in Poland. Read about it here: [Why We Chose 1Password for Managing Passwords in a Software House](https://geek.justjoin.it/dlaczego-wybralismy-1password-do-zarzadzania-haslami-w-software-housie/).
